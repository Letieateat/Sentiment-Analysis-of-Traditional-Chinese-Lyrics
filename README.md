> The present study investigates the sentiment analysis of Traditional Chinese lyrics. We created a dataset containing 1,002 mandopop lyrics labeled with seven sentiments, conducting three sentiment analysis tasks in three models: BERT-based-Chinese model, CKIP BERT-based-Chinese model, and GPT 3.5. The prompt-based approach with a hand-crafted prompt was applied to the GPT model. According to the results, the CKIP model outperformed the other models on all sentiment analysis tasks. In addition, a bigger batch size may enhance the performance of models for binary tasks, but a smaller size could be better for delicate tasks.
Furthermore, sadness and anxiety could be the two challenging sentiments for models regarding classification. Moreover, GPT-3.5 could potentially distinguish delicate sentiments better as it only failed on specific sentiments based on the confusion matrices. Applying different prompting methods may be a way to enhance the GPT model‚Äôs performance, which is worth future research.



## Project Dependencies
First, make sure you have Python 3.10.12 installed. You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install it via a package manager like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
To run the code in this project, you'll need to install several Python libraries. 

### Installation Instructions
